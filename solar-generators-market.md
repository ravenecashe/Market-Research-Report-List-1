<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Generators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-grid</li><li>Off-grid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar generator market is divided into two main types: on-grid and off-grid systems. On-grid solar generators are connected to the utility grid, allowing users to draw power from the grid and sell excess energy back. This system benefits from net metering and often reduces overall energy costs. Off-grid solar generators operate independently of the grid, relying on battery storage to provide power in remote locations or during outages, making them ideal for areas without access to electricity or enhanced energy independence.</p></p>
