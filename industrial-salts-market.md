<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Salts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brine</li><li>Salt Mines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial salts market consists of two primary sources: brine and salt mines. Brine refers to saltwater solutions derived from natural sources like underground salt deposits, which are evaporated to extract salt. This method is efficient and often used for producing large quantities of low-cost salt. In contrast, salt mining involves extracting rock salt from underground deposits through mining operations. This method typically yields higher purity salts and is suited for specialized applications. Both sources serve various industries, including chemical, food, and de-icing.</p></p>
